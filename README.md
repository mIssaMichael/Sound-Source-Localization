# Binaural Sound Source Localization

### Abstract 
Sound localization is a fundamental aspect of auditory perception, crucial for humans and
animals to navigate their environment. This paper explores sound localization techniques,
emphasizing feature extraction and machine learning for predicting the azimuthal direction
of sound sources. Classical methods such as Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interau-
ral Level Difference (ILD) provide foundational principles, while machine learning methods
supplement it. We implemented various feature extraction algorithms, including ITD, ILD,
spectral ITD, spectral ILD, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and trained a
Random Forest Classifier on these features. Using a dataset of high-frequency sound record-
ings, our model achieved high accuracy in predicting sound source locations. These findings
underscore the effectiveness of classical feature extraction coupled with modern machine
learning for sound localization tasks. Further research may explore applications in noisy
environments and real-time scenarios.
